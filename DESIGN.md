# Pain Point Design Document
## 1. Agent Input Design

### 1.1. Required Information

* **Pain Point Description**: A clear, natural-language statement of the business pain point (e.g., "Our support agents are overwhelmed by the high volume of repetitive questions").
* **Optional Context** (for future enhancements):

  * Channel (e.g., web, mobile, email, call): Identify where the pain point occurs
  * Industry (e.g., ecommerce, banking, etc.): Provide industry-relevant solutions

### 1.2. Input Format (JSON)

```json
{
  "pain_point": "Our support agents are overwhelmed by the high volume of repetitive questions.",
  "context": {
    "channel": "email",
    "industry": "ecommerce"
  }
}
```

**Rationale**:

* Structured JSON format makes it extensible for future context-aware reasoning.
* Enables easy integration with APIs or frontend systems.

## 2. Agent Output Design

### 2.1. Output Structure

Each solution recommendation should contain:

* `name`: Name of the proposed feature
* `description`: Brief summary of how it addresses the pain point
* `categories`: High-level product grouping
* `link`: URL to learn more
* `relevance_score`: Numeric score indicating match strength (0â€“1)

### 2.2. Output Format (JSON)

```json
[
  {
    "name": "AI Agent for FAQ & First Response",
    "description": "AI agents handle repetitive and common queries instantly, allowing human agents to focus on complex tasks.",
    "categories": ["AI Customer Service"],
    "link": "https://filum.ai/products/customer-service-ai",
    "relevance_score": 0.95
  }
]
```

**Rationale**:

* Easy for UI rendering or downstream automation
* Ranked by score for prioritization

## 3. Feature Knowledge Base Structure

### 3.1. Schema Design

Each feature in `solutions.json` should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "string", // Unique identifier
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "categories": ["string"], // Broad solution areas
  "modules": ["string"],
  "keywords": ["string"], // Search terms for basic matching
  "pain_points": ["string"], //Pre-defined problem statements
  "benefits": ["string"],
  "use_cases": ["string"], // Implementation scenarios
  "link": "string",
  "priority": "high | medium | low"
}
```

### 3.2. Example Entry

```json
{
  "id": "voc_surveys_post_purchase",
  "name": "Automated Post-Purchase Surveys",
  "description": "Trigger surveys automatically via email, SMS, Zalo, QR, POS, or web after a transaction to collect timely customer feedback.",
  "categories": ["Voice of Customer (VoC)"],
  "modules": ["Surveys"],
  "keywords": ["feedback collection", "post purchase", "survey"],
  "pain_points": ["We're struggling to collect customer feedback consistently after a purchase"],
  "benefits": ["Automatically trigger surveys after transactions"],
  "use_cases": ["E-commerce post-purchase feedback"],
  "link": "https://filum.ai/products/voice-of-customer/survey",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

**Rationale**:

* Enables effective keyword matching and future expansion with NLP.
* Supports multi-category/module association for broader coverage.

## 4. Agent Core Logic & Matching Approach

### 4.1. Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Input Ingestion**: Receive `pain_point` as JSON.
2. **Preprocessing**: Lowercase, remove punctuation, tokenize text.
3. **Matching Strategy**:

   * Match against `keywords` and `pain_points` fields in knowledge base.
   * Optionally use fuzzy matching or semantic similarity (e.g., sentence embeddings).
4. **Scoring**:

   * Compute a simple score (e.g., number of keyword matches / total keywords).
   * Normalize to range \[0, 1].
5. **Ranking and Filtering**:

   * Filter by a threshold (e.g., relevance\_score > 0.6).
   * Sort descending by score.
6. **Return Output**: Format and deliver structured solution list.

### 4.2. Matching Example

* **Input**: "We're struggling to collect customer feedback consistently after a purchase"
* **Matched Feature**: `Automated Post-Purchase Surveys`
* **Why**: Matches keywords like "feedback collection", "post purchase", and explicit pain point text.

## 5. Optional: Prototype Implementation

### 5.1. Directory Structure

```
```

### 5.2. Tools

* Python (basic NLP with NLTK or spaCy)
* JSON-based storage

### 5.3. Example Run

* Input: sample pain point
* Output: list of relevant Filum.ai features with scores
